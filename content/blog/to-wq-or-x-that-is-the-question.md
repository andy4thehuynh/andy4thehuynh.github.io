If your workflow consists of using Vim and commiting code with Github, you'll often see **THIS** screen:

<img src="/images/save_with_colon_x.png" alt="save_with_colon_x" />

**AND** you'll use `:wq` to save and quit Vim. Awesome!

Apparently `:x` does the **EXACT.. SAME.. THING**!

_Ugh_. Save some keystrokes, folks.
