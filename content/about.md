My name is Andy Huynh. I'm known on the internet as `andy4thehuynh`. It's punny and stuck through college. Speaking of college, I finished with degrees in political science and music. Far from software related, but they shaped my story.

A brief, bruttal internship in entertainment law started my transition to software.

In 2013, I joined Kajabi, a Ruby on Rails shop that targets the Internet Marketing niche. Six months later, I got an offer to join the team full time. The rest is history.

I enjoy being productive building feature requests and fixing bugs for Kajabi. I credit these guys for shaping me as a software developer: [Brendon Murphy](https://github.com/bemurphy), [Jeremy Saenz](https://github.com/codegangsta) and [Ben Hays](https://github.com/FuturaExtraBold). 

My best posts are from days at work
