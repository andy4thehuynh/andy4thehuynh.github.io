**You**. You're a professional developer on the Rails stack; not necessarily a newb. On the flip side, you haven't honed your skillset to be a senior developer. So, where do your skills lie?

Youâ€™re not making dramatic progress like when you started your programming journey. In the past, you'll pound through tutorials from popular sites like [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/), [TreeHouse](http://www.teamtreehouse.com) and [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) with a feeling of accomplishment. Need to loop through a collection in Ruby? No problem. Make a button animate in Javascript? Childs play.

We fashion the same boat. I'm a self-taught junior developer yearning for missing pieces in my programming game. Tasks such as creating a simple command line tool or scaling for 1000+ users are reminiscent of HS basketball tryouts and the feeling of insignificance. The sites I listed above don't prepare us for production ready applications.

The silver lining is to look until you latch on what you seek. DON'T GIVE UP! My search included an episode of [Ruby Rogues](http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/190-rr-apprenticeship-with-joseph-mastey-and-jill-lynch-of-enova) featuring [Joseph Mastey](https://github.com/jmmastey). He's doing big things at Enova which includes curating a program ([Level Up Rails](https://www.leveluprails.com/)) to get novice developers working towards commiting production level code on enterprise software. I was pleasantly shocked to learn he had full support from Enova to take coworkers of different departments and train them to be software engineers. His latest cohort enrolled 50+ students. His contribution lays a path for future large companies to follow.

Level Up Rails should be considered the defacto curriculum for intermediate developers. Skimming through the curriculum you'll notice it covers Unix utilities, handling data and best engineering practices. All free! I'm 1/4 finished and find myself skimming  through execises before work.

*"Confidence is the reward for being courageous."*

Being courageous is as simple as searching for answers when you're tired of searching. Don't give up.
