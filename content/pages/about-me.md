+++

I'm Andy Huynh. I go by the internet handle `andy4thehuynh`. It's punny and stuck with me through college. Speaking of college, I graduated from UC Irvine in 2012. I doubled in music and political science. Weird combo, I know.

My entertainment law career was shortlived but gave me a dedicated year to hone my computer programming skills.

In 2013, I joined Kajabi, a Ruby on Rails shop that targets the Internet Marketing niche. I interned, *pro bono*, six months until given an offer sheet to join the dev team. The rest is history.

I enjoy programming. It's empowering and quite addicting. Skills like coding, live music, and basketball (**all things I love**) are accelerated with a mentor. I credit my coding success to: [Brendon Murphy](https://github.com/bemurphy), [Jeremy Saenz](https://github.com/codegangsta) and [Ben Hays](https://github.com/FuturaExtraBold).
