My name is Andy Huynh. I'm known on the internet as `andy4thehuynh`. It's punny and stuck through college. I took longer to graduate, but finished UC Irvine with a double in political science and music.

A short internship in music entertainment law was all I needed to look for a new career.

In 2013, I joined Kajabi, a Ruby on Rails shop that targets the Internet Marketing niche. Six months into the internship, I got an offer to join the team full time. The rest is history.

It was painful learning to code, but all great skills are tough at first. I enjoy being productive working on feature requests and bugs for Kajabi. I am bless to learn from talented, accomplished developers: [Brendon Murphy](https://github.com/bemurphy), [Jeremy Saenz](https://github.com/codegangsta) and [Ben Hays](https://github.com/FuturaExtraBold).
