I'm Andy Huynh, but you already know that. My internet handle is `andy4thehuynh`. It's punny and stuck through college. Speaking of college, I graduated doubling in music and political science from UC Irvine in 2012.

My shortlived entertainment law career gave me a year to hone my computer programming dexterity.

In 2013, I joined Kajabi, a Ruby on Rails shop that targets the Internet Marketing niche. I interned six months until I received an offer to join the team full time. The rest is history.

I dig programming. It's empowering and artful. I am fortunate to work with such talented developers. I credit my coding success to: [Brendon Murphy](https://github.com/bemurphy), [Jeremy Saenz](https://github.com/codegangsta) and [Ben Hays](https://github.com/FuturaExtraBold).
