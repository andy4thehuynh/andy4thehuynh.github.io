I'm an observer, by nature. It seems like certain phrases or words come up repeatedly during daily standup. Especially when programmers talk shop.

It wouldn't hurt to sound like "one of them." I compiled a list that might help:

**Marriage** - when bringing two concepts together. (ex:)
**Coupled together** - stuck with or be associated with. (ex:)
**Secret Sauce** - what everyone and their moms want that you got.
