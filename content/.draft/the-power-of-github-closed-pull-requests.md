title = "The Power of Github Closed Pull Requests"
+++

A mature Github project contains a slew of closed pull requests. I'm a not so senior developer, nor am I junior anymore. These are the ways I get by the lack of experience and use other's experience as guides.

Closed Pull Requests are awesome. You can can search

``` how to search for pull requests -- with images.

Those are legit chunks of code that made it into the master branch. They serve as great reference guides to creating new features. Especially if said new features are layered on top of the closed pull requests.
