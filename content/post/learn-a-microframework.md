Warning: this is a slight rant (constructive nonetheless). Friends learning to code their own projects. Awesome! It's important you understand the underlyings of your machine. Tech is everywhere. Look out for smart fridges with an OS. I'm talking to you Samsung.

Anyways, it scares the grey hairs out of me when someone learns a colossal framework like Rails for starters. It's not incompetence, but I'll be damn if it won't be overwhelming. I am consistently confused and frustrated as a software apprentice and I have professional help two desks away. Rails buys you speed and efficiency with its magic factory settings. The magic is the sauce of Rails and buys you a ton when you're trucking on a project. For the newly initiated in the world of programming, save yourself the trouble. Find a microframework and start digging into the code.

Off the bat, you won't be marketable nor will you be more efficient with a microframework. However, you will be doing yourself a favor asking for what you CAN chew. Popular microframeworks like [Cuba](https://github.com/soveran/cuba) or [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) give you flexibility.
