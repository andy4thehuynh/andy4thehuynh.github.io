Hi, I'm Andy. I code for a living and love it.

Finding my first gig was difficult. Especially being self taught. I offered my services for free to [Kajabi](https://newkajabi.com/). Fast forward five years (started in 2013), they confidently dub me a full stack Rails developer.

To name a few - I'm responsible for Kajabi's initial signup flow during their 2016 launch that hit $1M within 24 hours. I implemented their affiliate program to which 9k active customers leverage for their online businesses. However, I'm most proud of intergrating the app with Paypal. Anyone who's worked with it can attest to how much therapy goes into all the headaches. It was a major level up in my career.

I blog about my thoughts, experiences and insights I learned along the way. Hopefully Rails developers, coming up in the ranks, will find my posts useful.

As an asid - I'm a LA Clippers fan, play blues music on a white Stratocaster and frequent comedy clubs to see the greats like Bill Burr and Louis CK.
